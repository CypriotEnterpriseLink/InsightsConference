                                Manolis is a full-stack backend developer at Covve bringing hands-on experience in a wide range of software projects. Integration with third party systems and performance monitoring are his main duties in the team; always guided by the principles of clean code and code optimization. As an example, he integrated Redis cache and Elasticsearch to the solution, thus assisting the release of v2 of Covve. </p><p>
In the past he worked on large scale corporate applications for the maritime sector challenged by the need of having an application working both online and offline while synchronizing multiple different databases and managing sensitive data. Being part of CNES (Centre Nationale dâ€™Etudes Spatiales) has imbued him with international experience and profound knowledge on algorithmic and computational intensive applications.
