                               Michael joined Covve since the beginning of the project when everything was just sketches on a whiteboard. He helped in transforming the idea into reality by taking part in both the architecture and actual development of what Covve is today. He is mostly kept busy developing the AngularJS frontend, wiring up CI automations, troubleshooting the GraphDB layer and doing the DevOps for the cloud infrastructure. </p><p>
He has been creating software solutions since 2004, having worked in NATO secret certified GIS and C&C defense software for over 5 years, having done a lot of freelance work building mostly for the web. His bachelor and masters are in EECE from the UoB and he also holds an MBA from AUEB.
