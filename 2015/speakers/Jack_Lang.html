"To get a promotion in those days, you had to wait for people to die. Making money was not the initial motivation, it was solving problems, and industry had better toys to play with. A gang of us used to meet in the tea room at the Computer Lab, and when we left the Lab we continued to meet in the pub or at dinners." Jack was Founder of Netchannel, which was acquired in 1998 by NTL, where he became Chief Technologist. Before that he founded Electronic Share Information, acquired by E*Trade in 1995.</p>

He is Entrepreneur in Residence at the Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning and a ByFellow at Emmanuel College. A keen baker and a passionate cook, he was one of the founders of Midsummer House restaurant in Cambridge. "I learnt most about setting up companies when I was Technical Director of Footlights: it was all about tight budgets, deadlines and people."</p>
                                <p>Jack Lang is also Co-Founder and Chair of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, an ultra-low cost computer designed to help teach kids programming.</p>
