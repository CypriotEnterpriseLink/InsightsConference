                                My professional start in life was as an undergraduate physicist. However fuelled by three separate passions I then switched my focus to a PhD in Computer Vision. Unfortunately none of these passions were requisite for a PhD and focussed instead on getting better at ballroom dancing, learning enough technology to start a technology business and spending more time among the dreaming spires of Oxford.</p><p>
Having achieved three out of three of these unfailable goals I then looked at the future of my PhD and realised that in two years time I could either have a doctorate or a successful company. My mother assured me that while she was definitely the sort of mother who would run down the beach shouting “help, help, my son, the doctor, is drowning!” she also knew where my heart really lay and would fully support me in pulling the rip cord, detaching the parachute and plummeting into entrepreneurship.</p><p>
Two years later I had neither a PhD or a successful company but did get to go on holiday to San Francisco. While there I met Paul Graham and mentioned to him what I was working on. Encouraged by his response sent I an application for YCombinator. My company, Clickpass was accepted and in 2007 I moved out to Boston and then later San Francisco in search of golden paving stones.
Eighteen months and many, many scrapes and stories later the deeds to the company were signed over to its new owner, Yola.com and I kicked back to enjoy sun in San Francisco, skiing in Tahoe and the joys of having an English accent in America.</p><p>
With a logic that surprised everyone, including myself I then turned my nose up at my newly minted visa and in 2010 headed back to London, burrowing into the depths of Shoreditch.
Over the next three years I product-managed teams at Yell labs, built a new mailing list application called Copyin for (slightly too few) delighted customers, built the infrastructure for Brojure.com and over many-many-weekends also built a piece of software that went on to become Twistilled.com</p><p>
When Coca Cola called up in September of 2014 I was starting to feel the itch to start a new company and so after realising just what an excellent team I would be working with there I signed an agreement to build Twistilled.com together with them in January 2015.</p><p>
I am now a Coca Coder and the the founder and CEO of Twistilled.com. In the few periods when I’m not writing code or persuading people to come and join me, I’m also a proud Part Time Partner and friend of the people at Entrepreneur First.
