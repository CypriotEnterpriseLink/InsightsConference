                                Alex is one of the co-founders and the CTO at Covve. He is also chief of SEO, HR manager, legal counsel, head of operations and, weather permitting, lead drone pilot.</p><p>
                                Alex had spent the last 10 years in London, in Deloitte’s IT consulting division. He advised  CIO’s on matters of IT strategy and outsourcing. Exciting as the work may have been, Alex  took the plunge from thirty thousand feet to leading a small crack product development team and getting his hands dirty on a daily basis.</p><p>
                                Apparently his experience in the high powered, super-efficient consulting industry coupled with his well hidden geeky side make him excellent glue between the chaos of the business and the equally chaotic reality of product development.
