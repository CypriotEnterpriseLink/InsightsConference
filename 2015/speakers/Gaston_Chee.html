                                <p>They call me the CEO when I started my first company and my duties includes preparing meals for employees, cleaning the toilet and delivery home starter packs to students arriving the UK for the first time. I raised a quarter of £M when at 23 and started businesses ever since. I Was expelled 3 times from school before making my way to one of UK's top university (Warwick) - how that happened? Date smart girls. However dating smart girls only takes you so far. 10 days before Christmas, the company I founded that was backed by one of UK's largest Venture Capital via an £8Million pound funding dismissed me as the CEO and also fired my co-founder and 8 other employees - looking back it was probably the best Christmas present ever.

A little bit about me (personal level)...
</p><p>
If I am not behind a monitor, at a whiteboard/A4 piece of paper sketching, collaborating with team members, or on the phone with client - you'll probably find me in the kitchen preparing and cooking food (was on TV and won the regional heat for ITV 1 Britain Best Dish 2011) or I'll be outdoor running (to burn away the calories - everything have to be balance right? ). I am also notorious for bad sense of direction, drinking too much coffee/wine and going too fast (whether it is talking, walking, running or driving!). Combining the three of these element is a recipe for disaster!

I was featured as one of the top 50 person of the year in 2014 for shaping the education landscape in China by Studying Abroad Magazine and was nominated for the Entrepreneur of the Year award 2014 by the British Chamber of Commerce in China and China Britain Council in recognition for promoting innovation, enterprise and endeavour in British and Chinese business. But I am more proud of my scars than my awards...the former is permanent while the latter is seasonal.                            </p>
